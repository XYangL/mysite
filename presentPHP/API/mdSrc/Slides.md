Limited Edit Space -- Slide-based

Authors have to edit the contents to fit on a slide or slides.


Shortcomings of slideware
============

##Limited Space ##

Slide-based:

Authors have to edit the contents to fit on a slide or slides.

##Strictly Sequentiality##

1. The presenter may want to present in different sequence from the predefined one
  - because present occasions are different
  - because available time is different
  - because some impromptu situation

2. There is Only one predefined sequence in PPT and Prezi

3. No support for a Plan B / Game Plan / Dynamic Sequence

4. E.G. : The presenter may prepare some spare slides for explaining a topic more
- If someone asks related questions, the presenter will show the slides
- If no one ask, the presenter does not need to show the slides

##Inevitable Linearity##
Only suitable for Hierarchical Structure, e.g linear or tree structure : 

NOT suitable for Complex Structure, e.g. graph

Current solution is using Interlink to Go Back or Duplicate when defining the sequence

Prezi and other ZUI tools provide an Unlimited Zoomable Canvas

##Fix Style##
The style must be pre-defined during authoring.

Do NOT support Content Adaptation:
- The style can NOT be changed while presenting
- The style can NOT be responsive to different factors (device, screen size)

Related Improvement
================================

##Approach based on ZUI##

1. Slide-based Plugin

2. Slide-free Paradigm
- Prezi
- Fly

##Approach based on different hardware##

multi-preaenter
